-- This project is about the KNN behavoiur on WaveForm Data from UCI Repository.

-- In the waveform data set, we have data 5000 waveforms data for 3 classes, and 21 attributes which include noise. The interesting aspect of this dataset is we know the Optimal Bayes classification rate which is 86 

-- This project includes the following:
  • Tuning the best k of a KNN Classifier
  • Analysing of bias-variance trade-off
  • Reducing the complexity(Using RNN and CNN)
  • Analysing artificial imbalancy
  
-- Please refer to report for detailed explanation of the project.
